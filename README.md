# ADex - MangaDex Reader for iOS

ADex (**A**pple Manga**Dex** Reader) is my attempt on creating a good looking and functioning MangaRock replacement for Apple devices, specifically for iOS devices.

The app is written using SwiftUI, so technically it's possible -- with some adjustments -- to use the same codebase for other Apple devices, which is why I call this app **A**Dex.

ADex uses MangaDex as its one and only source (since pretty much all the manga I follow are available there). I have no plan on adding other sources right now.
